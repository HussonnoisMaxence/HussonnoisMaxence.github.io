I am a Ph.D. student in Reinforcement Learning at the Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute(https://a2i2.deakin.edu.au)  at Deakin University in Australia. I am advised by Thommen George Karimpanal (https://www.thommengk.com) and Santu Rana (https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=S9PwnMYAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I interned at NAVER LABS Europe (https://europe.naverlabs.com/) with Hervé Déjean (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ADMeAc4AAAAJ&hl=fr) and Romain Deffayet (https://www.deffayet.cc/).  I've been nominated for the Pragnesh Jay Modi Best Student Paper Award at AAMAS 2023.


In my current research, I'm focused on autonomous skill discovery and how we can incorporate human feedback to learn a more desirable set of diverse skills in reinforcement learning.
